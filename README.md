## Introduction
In this project, I used Power BI to develop a dashboard for Adventure Works Cycles, a multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles across North America, Europe, and Asia. With its main operations based in Bothell, Washington, the company also operates a critical manufacturing plant in Mexico City, acquired in 2000. My primary focus was on addressing key business challenges within either the Sales or Production departments by leveraging data from the comprehensive AdventureWorks database.
### Sales Department Requirements
The Sales Department at Adventure Works Cycles consists of regional offices in the United States, Canada, England, Australia, Germany, and France, each managing its assigned sales territories. The team identified several key areas where they needed support:
1. **Customer Segmentation and Profiling**: The sales team requires tools to analyze customer data, identify top customers, anticipate potential issues, and understand purchasing behaviors across various demographic groups.
2. **Sales Activity**: The team needs to manage and apply discounts according to their roles, with support for international sales, including multilingual product information and multi-currency transactions.
3. **Internal Communication**: Sales representatives and managers require streamlined communication systems to receive and manage customer data, appointments, and internal updates, tailored to their specific roles.
4. **Opportunity Management**: The department needs an efficient way to track sales opportunities and convert them into orders without redundant data entry.
5. **Decision Support System**: The sales team requires tools for querying customer data, generating reports, tracking promotions, forecasting sales, and managing customer relationships across departments.
### Production Department Requirements
The Production Department at Adventure Works Cycles is responsible for converting raw materials into finished products, mainly focusing on environmentally friendly bicycles. The department oversees a complex inventory system with components stored in various locations across different countries and states. They identified the following needs:
1. **Inventory Control**: The department requires a more efficient way to review inventory status across all product categories. This includes supporting quantity control so that the Sales Department can be informed about current stock levels, anticipate stock shortages, and align marketing and production schedules to maximize sales and profit.
2. **Tracking Costs in Work Order Routing**: The team needs tools to analyze the cost of each operation sequence at different locations. This will help identify opportunities to optimize operational costs and minimize the cost of goods sold, ultimately improving profitability.
By developing an interactive Power BI dashboard, I aim to provide actionable insights that will enable Adventure Works Cycles to optimize their sales and production strategies. This dashboard will be a crucial tool for decision-makers, offering them a clear, data-driven view of the company’s performance metrics and key business indicators.
## Insight
1. **Regional Performance**:
   - Among the three main regions, North America consistently ranks as the top-performing market.
   - Within North America, the top three business regions are the Southwest, Canada, and the Northwest.
   - In 2014, North America's revenue growth rate led all three regions, continuing the trend from previous years. With significant sales spikes expected in September and December, North America is poised for continued growth.
   - Although North America generates the highest revenue, it also has the lowest profit margins due to higher production costs and long-distance shipping expenses.
2. **Product Focus**:
   - Bicycles remain the top-selling product category, highlighting the need to maintain a strong focus on this product line in the upcoming period.
   - Partnering with cargo companies for higher-quality deals could help optimize costs and improve logistics.
3. **Profitability by Region**:
   - The Pacific region, while generating lower overall revenue, offers the highest profit margins at 29%. This is attributed to lower production and material costs, as well as shorter and cheaper sea shipping routes.
   - Despite its high revenue, North America yields the lowest profit margin at just 3%, due to higher production costs and significant shipping expenses.
   - Europe shows a rapidly growing trend, particularly in March 2014, where revenue quadrupled compared to March 2013. However, the region faces challenges with unstable early-year revenue and high sea shipping costs.
4. **Additional Regional Insights**:
   - **Europe**:
     - Positive: Fast-growing, particularly strong in March with significant revenue increases.
     - Negative: Unstable revenue at the start of the year, with rapid declines toward the end. High sea shipping costs are also a concern.
   - **Pacific**:
     - Positive: Steady growth with a notable spike in October 2013, almost tripling revenue from the previous year. High profit margins due to low production and shipping costs.
     - Negative: Revenue is still comparatively low, and taxes in the region are slightly higher.
   - **North America**:
     - Positive: Top revenue generator in 2014, contributing around 60% of the company’s total sales. Lower shipping and tax costs due to short ground routes.
     - Negative: Revenue is volatile, with sharp increases and decreases making it unstable. High production costs and extensive shipping routes contribute to low profit margins.
